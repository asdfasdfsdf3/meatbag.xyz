**Building a Dank Memer auto farm script**\
I'm in the process of creating a script to automate Dank Memer tasks and farm free coins. I am only using beg, dig, and fish. Other commands are too risky. Script autosells all items it collects and autobuys a shovel or fishing pole if it doesn't have one. Additionally, the master account can issue a command to cause all farming accounts to open a trade, giving all their coins to the master. So far it's going very well. Hypothetically it can generate millions of coins a day off one account. This is for educational purposes only. I do not recommend you try this.
