**My Twitter is controlled by an AI**\
I'm using GPT-2 to generate tweeets following [this article.](https://minimaxir.com/2020/01/twitter-gpt2-bot/)\
The twitter API only allows me to scrape 3200 tweets from a given user, so I create a list of many similar accounts, scrape all possible tweets, and combine them into one giant csv. So far I've found the results to be good. Obviously it still requires some curation, but from every batch of generated tweets I find dozens that are usable.
